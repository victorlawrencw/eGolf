eGolf is a web3 game made for 3D artists, golf hobbyists and NFT enthusiasts.

# About
eGolf is a 3d golf game built using BabylonJS and working with Moralis.io as the central server, it is a game that makes good of NFT as an essential Game Asset(the golf courses of the game itself). The player is mandated to import or select an existing golf course that has its *START* and *END* marked, The golf ball will be placed in the START position and it will end on collision with the END(Will be further explained in [How To](#how-to).
I'd normally see the use of NFTs as a receipt but after making this project, I can see it play a much bigger role of being the actual product.
eGolf uses IPFS to store the imported golf courses(it saves the data if user is logged in) and returns the link to the player, the player may wish to sell his golf course as an NFT or share it with everyone on the eGolf platform.
The game has 3 golf club modes in the settings, each with specific designs, The settings also features 3 golf ball modes, they possess different use cases and designs.

# Development Story
I suck at story-telling, so bear with me.
The develop of eGolf started on 20 October 2021, and I was determined to make it a speed-testing project That will be completed within 7 days, I had a simple idea, which is to make a simple golf game using BabylonJS, then I heard about Web3 and I decided to make it a significant part of the project even though I knew little about it. So I did some research and then I remembered seeing an ad of Moralis on Youtube, so I signed up for moralis and started using it, I encountered some issues but I was able to overcome them, I also came across other ideas too, I did incorporate some and discarded many but in the end it all came together to make what we have here
